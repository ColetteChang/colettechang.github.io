          <p>If you’re about to begin your LL.M. journey in the United States—congrats! It’s going to be intense, exciting, and transformative. I’m sharing a few things I wish I had known before starting, based on my own experience and what I’ve learned from friends and classmates.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="1-choosing-a-school-location-and-ranking-matter-more-than-you-think">1. Choosing a School: Location and Ranking Matter More Than You Think</h3>

<p>Location isn’t just about weather—it affects your networking opportunities, access to firms, externships, and even your social life. Being in or near major legal hubs like New York, D.C., or San Francisco gives you more chances to attend events, meet professionals, and explore job options.</p>

<p>Ranking also plays a role—not just for resume value but for connecting with alumni and even making friends outside the law school bubble. A well-known university often means a broader international community and more diverse campus life.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-networking-you-should-have-started-yesterday">2. Networking: You Should Have Started Yesterday</h3>

<p>On orientation day, a speaker told us: “You should have started networking yesterday.” I thought it was a joke. It wasn’t.</p>

<p>You’ll wish you had started building connections earlier. My best advice? Start with people who share something in common with you—lawyers from your home country, people who speak your language, or those in your field of interest. Send cold emails. Ask for short chats. Most people are willing to help if you’re respectful and clear about your ask.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-know-your-goal-stay-or-go-home">3. Know Your Goal: Stay or Go Home?</h3>

<p>This one decision shapes your entire experience. If you’re planning to return home after the LL.M., you’ll probably enjoy your nine months more freely—traveling, exploring, and soaking in the cultural experience.</p>

<p>But if you want to stay in the U.S. after graduation, it’s a different story. You’ll need to plan your courses strategically, attend every networking event you can, and think seriously about your visa options and career path. It’s doable—but it’s also hard work.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-small-talk-its-not-that-scary">4. Small Talk: It’s Not That Scary</h3>

<p>Small talk felt awkward to me at first. But I learned one simple tip: just ask, “How are you?” and let the other person lead. Ask about their day, their classes, their plans—people usually enjoy talking about themselves. You don’t need to be clever. Just be curious and kind.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="5-find-a-job-or-externship-and-plan-ahead">5. Find a Job or Externship (and Plan Ahead)</h3>

<p>One of my regrets is not doing an externship. Because of visa limitations and poor planning, I missed the chance.</p>

<p>So here’s what I’d do differently: talk to alumni early. Ask what courses are useful for externships or bar eligibility. Learn how your law school works—what deadlines matter, what opportunities exist, and what mistakes to avoid. You only have nine months. Make them count.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>The LL.M. year goes by fast. You don’t need to have everything figured out on day one—but the more you know going in, the better you’ll make use of your time. Be intentional. Be curious. And enjoy the ride.</p>

<p>If you’re starting your LL.M. soon and have questions—or just want someone to talk to—feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to connect and help however I can. You’re not alone in this journey!</p>
