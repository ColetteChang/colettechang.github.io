When I was a kid, I watched the Singaporean movie series *I Not Stupid* with my family. Ever since then, Singapore has been a country defined by its strictness and organization in my mind. However, I never had the chance to visit until recently. Most people I knew described it as a boring place, only worth a single, one-time trip.

Even after I booked my flight, my brother and my boyfriend, who have both been there more than three times, questioned my decision. But I went anyway. After all, if it's a place only worth one trip, it would still be a first for me, wouldn't it?

As a four-day tourist, my observations and feelings are limited, but I made an effort to explore as much as possible. I took public transportation, visited tourist spots, and went to places where locals hang out, all to judge for myself if Singapore truly is a one-and-done destination. If I could describe the country in just three words, they would be: **clean, green, and well-organized**.

## A City of Cleanliness and Greenery

Singapore is remarkably clean. This isn't just limited to the fancy malls and tourist attractions; even the local food courts are impressively tidy. While they aren't as spotless as the malls, every diner returns their plates to a specific station. Cleaners are always on standby, ready to clear the shelves as soon as plates are placed on them, which prevents any public mess.

It's also an incredibly green city. From the moment you land at the airport, you're surrounded by lush greenery. Tourist hotspots like the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are truly amazing. Even simply walking through Gardens by the Bay or Fort Canning Park, you can feel how green the city is. Strolling through Fort Canning Park reminded me of walking through Central Park when I lived in New York City. You can breathe in the fresh air while still seeing the surrounding skyscrapers. The park is a great escape for busy people to take a deep breath. What I found even more fascinating about Fort Canning Park was its historyâ€”it was once a palace and a military base. I was amazed by how the Singaporeans have organized their city, seamlessly blending the old with the new.

## Masterful Organization

"Well-organized" is the third word I would use to describe Singapore, both financially and socially. You may know that about 80% of Singaporeans live in government-built housing called Flats. I was surprised to find that these Flats aren't in unpleasant locations; they're actually easily accessible by public transportation.

The public transit system is incredibly convenient. I took buses and the subway throughout my trip, except for the one-way taxi ride from the airport to my hotel with my brother. Many of my friends only take Grab or taxis in Singapore, but for me, taking public transportation is the best way to see how a city truly functions. It was also very convenient for a tourist to use Apple Pay with a foreign credit card, which is a lot like using the subway in New York City but different from Taipei.

When I purchased tickets for various attractions, I was always asked if I was a citizen or resident because locals pay much less. As a tourist, I was impressed by how the government has smartly developed places to generate income from visitors. For example, the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are entirely tourist-focused. Since Singapore is so humid, these greenhouses are perfect places for tourists to escape the heat, enjoy nature, and get a great view of the city.

The National Gallery is another brilliant example. It was formerly the Supreme Court and City Hall. If these two historic buildings hadn't been repurposed, the government would still have to pay for their upkeep. But by opening them as a gallery, they can generate revenue from ticket sales and private events. What a great deal! The current Supreme Court building is, in contrast, a rather plain government building. But from a business perspective, a functional government building doesn't need to be in a historical site; it just needs to serve its purpose.

During a tour at the National Gallery, the guide also told me that all the collections were either donated or purchased at a very low price. For example, one painting was bought when the artist had just gotten out of jail, and its value has since multiplied many times over. So clever.

## Must-Try Food and Travel Tips

During my trip, I also enjoyed some of Singapore's famous street food. I went to **Ya Kun Kaya Toast**, **Song Fa Bak Kut Teh**, and **Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice**. They were all absolutely delicious and worth every calorie. 

If I had to give some suggestions for people traveling to Singapore, here they are:

1. **Jewel Changi is overrated.** It has a very artificial vibe, and two hours is more than enough time there.
2. Go to the **National Gallery Singapore** or the **National Museum of Singapore** instead. You can learn more about the country's history. Remember to check the schedule and join a public tour. Additionlly, I personally think 's the top floor garden of the National Gallery has a great spot to see the F1 race. 
3. Try to find food in the **food courts**. It's much cheaper than in restaurants and has a great chance to people-watch and observe locals.
4. **Take public transportation** to see how convenient and organized it is.
5. **Explore the city**, and don't forget to drink  water and apply sunscreen! It's a really humid place!
