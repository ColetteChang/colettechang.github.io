Growing up in Taiwan, the whole concept of "prom" was a bit foreign to me. We didn't have that tradition of fancy dresses, the awkward process of finding a date, or the exclusive "invitation only" after-prom beach party. So when my boyfriend first told me about his high school prom experience, or rather, his lack thereof, I found it both amusing and incredibly sweet.

Ten years ago, as his high school days were winding down, prom weekend approached. But instead of getting the coveted invite to the beachside bash, he and a handful of his guy friends found themselves in a similar predicament. They might have even had dates with single female friends, but the big, popular after-party remained out of reach. In their words, they were "too lame" to be part of the typical prom scene. So, what did they do? They decided to create their own fun weekend. They packed their bags and headed to the Poconos, where they spent their "prom weekend" rafting, playing paintball and doing whatever they wanted. It was a weekend just for them, focused solely on guy-time.

Fast forward a decade, my boyfriend decided it was time to launch "Prom Weekend 2.0," a 10-year anniversary celebration, inviting those same high school friends and their partners back to the Poconos. We went back to the paintball course and even rafted down the same river. Our evenings were filled with classic after-party vibes: BBQ, board games, and plenty of s'mores by the fire.

As an "outsider" to their high school history, it was fascinating to observe this full-circle moment. Time truly flies. Two of those friends who once felt "too lame" to get a prom after-party invite are now getting married this year! It's a powerful reminder that the judgments and anxieties of our late teens often fade into insignificance.

We're all in our late twenties now, and looking back ten years feels like an eternity. What made us feel "lame" or inadequate back then probably means absolutely nothing to us today. This "Prom Weekend 2.0" taught a vital lesson: we shouldn't let society define who we are. Being invited to a certain party or fitting into a popular crowd doesn't determine our worth.

Instead, we should keep our heads down, focus on what we genuinely love, and work towards becoming the people we want to be. A decade from now, the opinions and judgments of others won't matter. What will matter are the experiences we embraced, the friendships we nurtured, and the genuine joy we found along the way. So, let's embrace every moment, create our own adventures, and fill our minds with memories, not with the fleeting judgments of others.
