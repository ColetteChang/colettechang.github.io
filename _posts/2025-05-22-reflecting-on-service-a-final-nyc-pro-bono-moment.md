Leaving NYC has been busy, but I knew I couldn't leave without doing one last pro bono clinic. It was important to me to say goodbye to all the wonderful lawyers and volunteers I've had the pleasure of working alongside.

Yesterday, as I wrapped up my final pro bono session in NYC's Chinatown, I received this lovely cake from the Asian American Bar Association of New York (AABANY). It was such a thoughtful surprise and a wonderful recognition of my first year of pro bono service here.

The timing of it all brought a vivid memory to mind: ten years ago, during my second year of college in Tainan, when I used to ride my bike to do pro bono service for the Legal Aid Foundation. This journey of giving back, now spanning continents, deeply reinforces my fundamental duty as a lawyer.

It's incredible to think how quickly time has flown. I've literally crossed the world, yet the spirit of volunteerism and helping different communities remains a constant in my life. Each pro bono hour, whether with the Legal Aid Foundation and NCKU Legal Service Clinic in Tainan, the Judicial Reform Foundation in Taipei, or with AABANY in New York, reminds me that it's not just about practicing law. It's about using my skills to make a tangible difference in people's lives and contribute to a stronger, more just society.

As I close this chapter in NYC and finish packing, I'm filled with immense gratitude for the connections made and the opportunity to serve. A huge thank you to AABANY for this sweet gesture and for fostering such a great environment for legal professionals to give back. I'll carry the spirit of this community with me wherever my next adventure takes me.
