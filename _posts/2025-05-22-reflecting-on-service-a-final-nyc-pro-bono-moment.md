My departure from NYC has been a busy one, but I couldn't leave without participating in one last AABANY pro bono clinic. It was essential to say goodbye to the wonderful lawyers and volunteers I've had the pleasure of working with.

As I wrapped up my final pro bono session in NYC's Chinatown yesterday, the Asian American Bar Association of New York (AABANY) surprised me with a thoughtful cake—a lovely recognition of my year of pro bono service here.

This moment instantly transported me back ten years, to my second year of college in Tainan, when I'd bike to my pro bono service at the Legal Aid Foundation. This continuum of giving back, now spanning continents, deeply reinforces my core duty as a lawyer.

It's astonishing how quickly time passes. I've literally traveled across the globe, yet the commitment to volunteerism and aiding different communities remains a constant. Each pro bono hour—whether with the Legal Aid Foundation and NCKU Legal Service Clinic in Tainan, the Judicial Reform Foundation in Taipei, or with AABANY in New York—underscores that law is more than just a profession. It's about leveraging my skills to create real change in people's lives and build a more equitable society.

As I close this NYC chapter and finalize my packing, I'm profoundly grateful for the chance to serve. A heartfelt thank you to AABANY for cultivating such an excellent environment for legal professionals to contribute. The spirit of this community will accompany me on my next journey.
