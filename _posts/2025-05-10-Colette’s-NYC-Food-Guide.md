I've now spent a full year in this wild, exciting, and chaotic city.

I still wouldn't call myself a local — more like a one-year tourist who just happened to live here. I wandered through a lot of neighborhoods and ate a lot of meals. Some were nostalgic, some were surprising, and some were simply comforting in the middle of a homesick week.

Here's a list of the places that stood out — categorized so you can find what you're craving, with honest notes from someone who's still exploring.

## 🥯 Breakfast & Brunch

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Liberty Bagels (Midtown & FiDi)</b></span>  
My favorite bagel in NYC. I was skeptical of the rainbow bagel at first, but it turned out to be surprisingly delicious and totally unforgettable. I usually stop by when taking visitors to Central Park or Wall Street. I recommand trying one sweet (Oreo, blueberry, or Nutella) and one savory such as lox, avocado, egg and cheese— and share with friends. They also do festive holiday bagels that are photogenic.

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Ellen's Stardust Diner (Midtown)</b></span>  
If you're short on time or budget and can't catch a Broadway show, this diner is a fun alternative. The food isn't anything special, but the live singing waitstaff give you a little taste of musical theater magic while you eat.

## 🍽️ Lunch & Dinner

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Maison Pickle (Upper West Side)</b></span>  
My favorite restaurant in the city!!! The French toast fried chicken is unreal: it's sweet, spicy, savory, crispy, and soft. The buffalo mac & cheese is pure comfort. The garlic bun is famous, but I personally prefer the herb one more. For dessert, try the Oreo cake, even though the signature 24-layer cake looks cooler.

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Prince Street Pizza (SoHo)</b></span>   
The square slice here is iconic — thick, crispy, cheesy, and a little greasy in the best way. It's probably too heavy for a typical Taiwanese stomach, but hey, you're in NYC! Embrace the junk food.

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Sakagura (Midtown East)</b></span>  
High-quality Japanese food that's still affordable. Come for the weekday lunch special! Surprisingly fulfilling and tucked away in a hidden basement, which makes it feel like a delicious little secret.

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Mala Project (East Village & Midtown)</b></span>  
The best dry pot I've had in Manhattan. Still not Asia-level, but flavorful and comforting if you're craving that numbing spice.

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Maxi's Noodle (Flushing)</b></span>  
The best wonton I've had in the U.S. I made the trip to Flushing just for it — twice! Still need to try their Manhattan location.

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Dhamaka (Lower East Side)</b></span>  
A high-quality Indian restaurant that delivers bold flavors and unique dishes. Definitely try the biryani - the pot is covered by bread! A really traditional way to make the dish. Also, don't miss the dessert! It's exotic, but surprisingly tasty. A great spot when you want something different and exciting.

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Bar B (Greenwich Village)</b></span>  
A tiny standing bar with great happy hour and fun energy. No seats, but that's part of the charm. Perfect for a quick bite before heading to dessert with friends.

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Keens Steakhouse (Midtown)</b></span>  
Not a place I'd go alone, but perfect when family visits. Classic NYC steakhouse with rich dishes. Bonus: their desserts come from top bakeries like Eileen's Special Cheesecake — so you get the best without the line.

## 🍰 Desserts & Cafés

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Bibble & Sip (Midtown)</b></span>   
Their cream puff is light, flavorful, and just indulgent enough — reminds me of the quality I'd expect in Asia. Yes, it's pricey, but a perfect homesick cure when you're craving something sweet and familiar.

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Cha-An Teahouse (East Village)</b></span>  
A lovely matcha spot with thoughtful desserts and a calm, cozy atmosphere. Get there right when it opens to avoid a wait — it fills up quickly for good reason.

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Anita La Mamma del Gelato (Upper West Side)</b></span>  
My go-to ice cream spot (been here over five times). Rich, creamy, and full of fun flavors. Still looking for something to beats The Franklin Fountain in Philly.

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Veniero's Pasticceria & Caffe (East Village)</b></span>  
Old-school Italian café with huge slices of cake and a cozy, uncrowded vibe. The cheesecake is solid. Not a "must-go," but a lovely stop if you're in the area after dinner.

## 🌙 Late Night Eats

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Katz's Delicatessen (Lower East Side)</b></span>  
A New York legend. Huge pastrami sandwiches and chaotic vintage vibes. Tip: Go after midnight after bar— they're open 24/7, and you'll skip the crazy lines.

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>Double Chicken Please (Lower East Side)</b></span>  
This bar is crazy busy — I don't think I'd wait in that line again. But if you've never been and you're curious, the tea-based cocktails are genuinely impressive. It's rare to find cocktails with this kind of tea flavor and balance in the U.S. Worth trying once… if you have the patience.

## 🍗 Street Food

<span style="color:rgb(217, 0, 148);"><b>The Halal Guys (Midtown)</b></span>  
I'm not usually a street food person, but this one is famous. Just make sure you go to the right cart: the original one at 6th Avenue & W 53rd St (and the one directly across the street is also legit). Don't be fooled by other food trucks using the same name — they're not quite the same. (This tip comes from someone who used to be a huge Halal Guys fan.) The combo platter with white sauce is the classic order.

After one year of eating my way through the city, I still don't feel like I've scratched the surface — but these places left an impression. Some brought comfort when I missed home, some surprised me, and some were just fun.

If you're visiting or just moved here, I hope this list gives you a few ideas to start with. And if you have better gelato recommendations — let me know. I'm still looking.
