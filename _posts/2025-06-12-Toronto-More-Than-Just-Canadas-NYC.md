Before traveling to Toronto with my boyfriend last week, he, having lived there from ages two to seven, confidently declared it "basically New York City." He even claimed many movies seemingly set in NYC were actually filmed in Toronto. I was skeptical until our air train ride when someone held the door for his friends, a familiar scene in NYC subway. Ironically, that helpful person actually turned out from NYC, leaving me still curious whether Toronto's true identity.

Niagara Falls gave me some serious Vegas vibes, primarily due to the casino. However, driving through the suburbs felt remarkably similar to any suburbs I had encountered in the US. After sightseeing downtown Toronto half day, I would say the notable differences from NYC includes: less weed smell, fewer homeless individuals, but just as much bustling traffic. As someone truly enjoy observation, I truly wished I had more time.

One unexpected highlight of our trip was "Little Canada." What I initially assumed was a children's attraction captivated us for two and a half hours. The intricate miniature displays were truly delicate works of art, offering fascinating insights into Canada's geography and fueling my desire to explore more of the country.

Niagara Falls itself offers a variety of sightseeing options. The Niagara City Cruises is an obviously unique experience, though I found it challenging to keep my eyes open and fully appreciate the nature while the cruise was directly underneath the waterfall. The Niagara Parks Power Station was also distinctive, best suited for those with a general interest in how power plants operate, or who, like me, enjoy the novelty of traversing a long tunnel.

To be honest, I didn't have high expectations for the food before the trip. However, I discovered several delightful surprises. Toronto is known for poutine, Nanaimo bars, and BeaverTails. I had poutine at Niko's Place in Niagara Falls. While my boyfriend's Toronto relatives insisted Niagara Falls isn't the place for good poutine, I found Niko's rendition to be exceptionally tasty, and it seemed popular with many locals.

We explored St. Lawrence Market for street food. The lobster roll from Buster's Sea Cove was decent; the lobster was fresh, though not overwhelmingly amazing. It was, however, a quick and convenient option if you only order their signature lobster roll, as they seemed to have pre-prepared ingredients. At Carousel Bakery, we tried the most famous Peameal Bacon Sandwich, which offered a lot of sauce options. The meat was quite unique, and I preferred the bread significantly over the lobster roll's. After all, it's a sandwich from a bakery. How could the bread be anything but good?

We also tried Nanaimo bars downstairs at the market. They were acceptable, not fantastic, but not bad either. I'd say they were worth a try, but perhaps not a second, with so many other tempting sweets awaiting. The bagels in the market looked distinctly different from their NYC counterparts, but I had reached my "carb maximum" for the day, so I didn't get a chance to try them.

BeaverTail was definitely my favorite food during the whole trip. I craved it after my first bite in downtown Toronto and made sure to have another before my flight leaving the city. Essentially, it's fried dough with your favorite toppings. How can you not love it? If I can't return for another, I'll likely attempt to make it myself. To be honest, I was already searching for how to make it on my way to the airport! Please don't miss it when you visit Toronto!

And for souvenirs, make sure to grab some Ketchup Chips! They taste remarkably similar to 卡迪那 (Cadina) Ketchup Chips, a popular snack brand from Taiwan and one of my personal favorites.
