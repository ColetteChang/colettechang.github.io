Tomorrow marks my 29th birthday! Even though I know everyone has their own timeline, I'm still nervous because it will be my last 365 days before my 30s begin.

I went skydiving on the first day of my 28th year. I still cringe a little watching that video because my eyes were squeezed shut the whole way down! I still feel really embarrassed about it. However, in some way, that jump pretty much set the tone for my entire 28th year. It was about facing fears, even if I wasn't looking directly at them.

During my 28th year, I lived in New York City and worked at a UN-affiliated organization; it truly felt like I was living and working at the center of the world. This year, I got the chance to meet so many people from different sectors, from diplomats to tech founders. Most of them are working on incredibly "cool" projects. I did absorb more knowledge and information than ever before. However, a lot of the time, there's a tiny knot of fear in my stomach, I won't lie. Often, I feel like I'm nowhere, still trying to figure things out. Though I know everyone has their own timeline, I'm often afraid I'm behind my peers.

When I think about my 28th year, that jump is vivid. Life, much like that skydiving experience, is often about trying new things even when you're scared. You might not have all the answers, and you might not be able to see the landing, but you still take the leap. And you learn to trust that the parachute will open.

I'm incredibly grateful for my wonderful partner, who constantly pushes me out of my comfort zone â€“ from that terrifying skydive to those essential but often intimidating networking events. They remind me that growth often happens when you're a little bit scared.

And now, here I am, on the eve of my last year before 30, and preparing to move out of NYC. I'll always remember how NYC made me stronger. In these last 365 days before my 30s begin, I'll keep walking through the doors that open for me, keep searching for what truly ignites my passion, and keep working hard. I'm ready to keep soaring and enjoy the new adventure, even with my eyes wide open this time (hopefully!).
