The greatest thing about living in NYC for me is that you can often enjoy world-class performances at an affordable price. As someone who averages 2–3 shows per week and scores up to 5 lottery tickets weekly, I've explored the best ways to enjoy Broadway, opera, ballet, and more — without breaking the bank.

Here are the platforms and tricks I use to consistently find great deals:

---

### 🎟️ Broadway

- **Lucky Seat** – Lottery for select Broadway and off-Broadway shows: [luckyseat.com](https://luckyseat.com)
- **Broadway Direct** – Official lottery for major shows like The Lion King and Wicked: [broadwaydirect.com](https://broadwaydirect.com)
- **Telecharge** – Offers both rush and lottery tickets: [telecharge.com](https://telecharge.com)
- **TodayTix App** – A go-to for mobile lotteries, rush tickets, and same-day deals
- **Hamilton App** – Runs a $10 digital lottery. I've entered many times — it's a great deal, but the odds are low, so I don't rely on it.

**Bonus tip:** Some theaters offer in-person rush tickets when the box office opens. I haven't personally tried it, but it's worth checking if you're nearby early in the day. Look up each show's rush policy on its official site.

### 🎼 Opera

- **Met Opera App** – Daily digital lottery with $25 orchestra seats
- **Met Opera 40 Under 40** – Offers $40 tickets and exclusive events for ages 21–40: [metopera.org](https://www.metopera.org)

### 🩰 Ballet

- **NYCB's 30 Under 30** – New York City Ballet offers $30 tickets to anyone under 30: [nycballet.com](https://www.nycballet.com)

### 🎭 Theater for Young Audiences

- **Manhattan Theatre Club: 30 Under 35** – $30 tickets and post-show events for those under 35: [manhattantheatreclub.com](https://www.manhattantheatreclub.com)

### 🧑‍🎓 Student Discounts

Many shows offer special discounts for students, either online or at the box office with a valid student ID. I haven't had a chance to use these myself, but if you're a student, definitely check — it can save you a lot!

### ⏳ Willing to Wait in Line? Try TKTS

- **TKTS Booths** offer same-day tickets at up to 50% off for Broadway and off-Broadway.
- See what's available before you go: [TKTS Live](https://www.tdf.org/nyc/81/TKTS-Live)
- I tried the Lincoln Center TKTS booth once — it's quieter than Times Square. That was actually the first time I bought a Broadway ticket as a tourist. I haven't used TKTS again since, but it's a solid option if you're okay with waiting and the shows you want to watch do not have lottery options.

### 🎫 Other Discount Options

- **TDF Membership** – Students, educators, artists, and nonprofit workers can get deep discounts on hundreds of shows: [tdf.org](https://www.tdf.org)

Enjoy the shows!
