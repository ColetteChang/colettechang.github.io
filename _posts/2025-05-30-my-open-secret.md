I want to be open with you all about something that has become an integral part of my writing process: I'm using AI to help craft my blog posts. Some of you might have noticed this through occasional unusual phrasing or tone. While I'm actively learning to refine my prompts to avoid this, I'm also genuinely hoping for your insights.

I'm not surprised if some of you criticize this approach, perhaps saying, "Stay away from AI if you want to be a good writer," or "Don't let AI hinder your learning." While I understand these concerns, I hold a different point of view.

My perspective stems from a crucial personal experience: the persistent gap between how I articulate my thoughts in Chinese, my native language, and how I express them in Englishâ€”even though my English is at a C2 level. This isn't just about direct translation; it's about nuance, idiomatic expressions, and the subtle ways ideas are structured within different linguistic frameworks.

For me, AI isn't a shortcut to avoid thinking; it's an incredibly powerful tool that empowers non-native English speakers like me. I'm not asking AI to write my story for me; I want it to help me write my story! AI allows me to convey my ideas with greater confidence and precision to a global audience. Conversely, it enables the world to more easily access knowledge and perspectives from individuals in non-English speaking countries.

You can't deny that English's dominance as a global language, while understandable, inadvertently creates a significant barrier for many. It can unintentionally obscure the true talent and brilliance originating from non-English speaking societies. It's a genuine disadvantage for those of us who were born and raised speaking a different primary language. We are often compelled to use English to build our professional reputation on the global stage, simply because we exist in an English-dominated world.

Think about it: isn't it rather absurd that someone's perceived competence might be unfairly judged simply because they can't express their ideas in English with the same native fluency? Yet, this has been the reality for centuries.

AI bridges this gap. It's a revolutionary step towards a more inclusive global conversation, allowing ideas to transcend linguistic hurdles. That's precisely why I'm using AI to help me write and post in English instead of Chinese. Who would translate all articles from another language context? And based on current technology, I believe direct translation alone cannot ensure you read exactly what I mean if I were to use Chinese as my primary language for all my posts.

While using AI to deliver my ideas, I'm continually striving to improve my English. I would genuinely appreciate any feedback from native English speakers on my language use. Your insights are invaluable as I continue this journey. I'd particularly love to hear your feedback if you find any phrases or constructions in this article that feel unnatural, awkward, or overtly "AI-ish" to you. Pointing these out would be incredibly helpful for my learning.

Thank you for reading, and for understanding my commitment to sharing my voice with the world, with a little help from technology. I look forward to your valuable advice!
