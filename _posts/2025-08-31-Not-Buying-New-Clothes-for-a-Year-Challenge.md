Now I’m sitting at the desk in my childhood room, the same one I've lived in for over 20 years. After two years in the United States, it feels surreal to be back in my parents' home.

As I’ve been unpacking, I'm struck by how much stuff I have. My closet is overflowing with clothes I haven't worn in years, and now it's even more crowded with everything I brought back. The two giant bookshelves in my room are full of books I never got around to reading, and yet I've returned with even more. There are so many random things I thought I needed that have just collected dust.

Over the last two years, I moved from Philly to New York City and then to the suburbs of Pennsylvania. Each time, I hauled my belongings with me. But the big moves were the cross-country ones—the journey from Taiwan to the U.S. and back again. For those, I only used two large suitcases and a huge bag—around 120 pounds, which is more than I weigh. And even with all of that, I still have so many things left behind in the U.S or Taiwan when I move. I convinced myself this was the price of an unstable life, a necessary cost for someone who hadn't settled down. 

Then I came across the "Not Buying New Clothes for a Year Challenge" online. Instead of being skeptical, I felt a sense of relief and excitement. The constant moving had left me exhausted from the burden of "having too much stuff."

A quick check of my credit card statements showed the last time I bought a piece of clothing was back on April 14, 2025. I already have a head start! Even before I decided to take the challenge, I'd already gone four months without a new purchase.

For me, this challenge is about more than just a financial statement; it's a chance to truly understand my own lifestyle. It’s about being mindful of what I already have, what I genuinely need, and what kind of life I want to create for myself.

This "living with less" idea also resonates with something I recently learned about meditation. I never understood why people said meditation was good until I watched Jay Shetty’s commencement speech at Princeton University. He explained that the benefit of meditation isn't about gaining something, but about getting rid of things—letting go of anxiety, stress, and noise.

This mindset that "less is more" and that getting rid of things can be a positive act has shifted my perspective. I think it's an important thought for anyone who thinks a challenge like this might be too hard.

So, I’m starting my "Not Buying New Clothes for a Year Challenge" today. My biggest worry now is not knowing where I'll be next. Will I be somewhere cold or hot? Will I be on the move again soon? But despite those unknowns, I'm ready to try. It’s a step toward a less cluttered, more meaningful life.  I’ll update the result of this challenge and how I feel next year September 1, 2026.
