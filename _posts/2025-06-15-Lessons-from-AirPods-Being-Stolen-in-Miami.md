Today is my third day in Miami. Before finding my AirPods missing this morning, I was telling everyone how great the city is: good food, clean streets, almost no visible homelessness, and even free public transportation!

However, everything changed after I realized my AirPods were gone. I consider myself cautious, rarely misplacing anything. Yet, my AirPods were missing! Using the "Find My" app on my iPhone, I located them at: 1025 NW 105th St, Miami, FL 33150.

I immediately went to the hotel lobby, asking if they could check if something went wrong with housekeeping. While I'm not 100% sure, it's highly possible my AirPods were on the table in my hotel room when they were taken. The hotel manager took down details and said he'd deal with it. Based on his promise to get back to me, I didn't file a police report right away, trusting the hotel.

After about six hours without any feedback, I followed up. The manager had already left. Another hotel staff member told me they couldn't help and refused to share any information about the housekeeping personnel.

Frustrated, I tried to get help from the police. I called them, explaining I had the device's exact location. Their response was blunt: they said they wouldn't deal with the theft of electronic items like AirPods. It was obvious the stolen item was at that location, but the police wouldn't intervene.
So, driven by desperation, I drove to the address. I circled the house, nervous because online advice warns against confronting people, especially since Florida residents can legally possess guns. We also wanted to avoid wrongly accusing someone, so we carefully re-checked the location. The person inside closed the door and denied having them, but my "Find My" app clearly showed the AirPods were right there!

Trying to process the entire ordeal calmly, here are some painful lessons I learned:

<span style="color:rgb(20, 152, 193);"><b>Lesson 1: Don't Assume Your Hotel Room is Safe</b></span>

Before this trip, I never thought I'd worry about items going missing in a 4-star hotel. I was wrong. My AirPods vanished from my room, and circumstances strongly suggest they were taken by someone with access, most likely during housekeeping.
The first, undeniable lesson is this: Do not assume the items you leave in your hotel room are safe. It doesn't matter if it's a budget motel or a luxury resort. Even seemingly less valuable items, like AirPods, can be targets.
Here's what I'll keep in mind going forward: Always Keep valuables out of sight.

<span style="color:rgb(20, 152, 193);"><b>Lesson 2: Don't Count on Law Enforcement (or the Hotel) for Recovery</b></span>

This was perhaps the most jarring realization for me, especially coming from Taiwan, where police are generally very proactive in theft cases, regardless of an item's value. In Miami, my experience was starkly different.

As I mentioned, after discovering my AirPods were gone, I immediately checked "Find My" and had their clear, precise location. I reported this to the hotel manager, who initially seemed concerned and promised to "deal with it." I trusted this assurance and delayed filing a police report.

Six hours later, with no follow-up, I pressed again. The response was blunt: "There is nothing they can do," and they refused to share any information about the housekeeping staff.

When I finally contacted the Miami police, explaining I had the exact location, their response was equally disheartening. They effectively told me they wouldn't deal with the theft of electronic items like AirPods.

<span style="color:rgb(20, 152, 193);"><b>Lesson 3: Apple, We Need Real Theft Protection</b></span>

My frustration extends beyond the hotel and the police to Apple I have AppleCare on my AirPods, and it's still in coverage. Yet, in the face of theft, it's utterly useless. AppleCare covers accidental damage, but for a device that's stolen, you're left completely in the dark.

"Find My" is a brilliant tool for locating a device, but it falls short when that device is in the hands of a thief. My final, most passionate lesson, and a plea to Apple:  <span style="color:rgb(235, 59, 109);"><b>Why can't we deactivate stolen devices to truly brick them, rendering them useless to thieves? </b></span>This isn't just about my AirPods; it's about a fundamental gap in device security that leaves countless victims feeling powerless.

This experience was a bitter pill to swallow. While Miami still has its charms, it served as a stark reminder: travel with vigilance, protect your belongings as if no one else will, and understand the limitations of external help. <span style="color:rgb(235, 59, 109);"><b>And to Apple, I sincerely hope you're listening. Your users deserve better protection against theft!</b></span>
